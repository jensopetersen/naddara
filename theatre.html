        <h3>Theatre</h3>
        <p>From Sauna’s full length Arabic dramas (with more than one act), which he himself in
            various articles of <i>Abou Naddara</i> and in his unpublished <i>Memoires</i> claims to
            have been thirty-two in number,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> only
            one was published as a separate book during his lifetime: <i>Mūliyīr
                Miṣr wa-mā yuqāsī</i> (The Egyptian Molière and What He
                Suffers).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> However, according to
            Ibrāhīm ʿAbduh,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> a one
            act piece called <i>Il marito infedele</i>, was published in Italy already in 1876.
            Matti Moosa additionally mentions the Arabic title of a French play -<i>al-Salāsil
                al-Muḥaṭṭama</i> (The Shattered Chains)- which according to him,
            appeared in Paris in 1911.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>As sketches and dialogues were amply spread throughout Sanua’s diverse journals,
            Najwā Ibrāhīm ʿAnūs undertook the task of collecting the
            ones which must be classified as theater plays directly from the magazines.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Another scholar, Muḥammad
            Yūsuf Najm published eight plays –<i>The Egyptian Molière</i> among them- from the
            manuscripts, Sanua’s daughter Louli Milhaud-Sanua had preserved, in the third of his
            volumes about Arabic theatre.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> These
            eight however, can be reduced to seven because one of them is a short dialogue between
            an English tourist and donkey-boy (<i>as-ssawwāḥ
                wa-al-ḥammār</i>). </p>
        <p>Sanuaʾs preserved full length plays are therefore, namely, <i>būrṣat
                miṣr</i> (The Egyptian Stock Market), <i>al-ʿalīl</i> (The Sick),
                <i>abū rīda l-barbarī wa-maʿshūqatuh kaʿb al-khayr
            </i>(The Black Abū Rīda and His Beloved Kaʿb al-Khayr),
                <i>aṣ-ṣadāqa aʿnī zawāg as-sitt warda maʿ
                ibn ʿammihā</i> (Faithfulness: I mean [i.e. this is to say] Miss Warda’s
            Wedding to Her Cousin), <i>al-amīra l-iskandarānīya</i> (the
            Alexandrian Princess), <i>aḍ-ḍarratayn</i> (The two Co-Wives) and
                <i>mūliyīr miṣr wa-mā yuqāsī</i> (The Egyptian
            Molière and what He Suffers). All of them are introduced as comedies and describe, in a
            satirical way, old and new social habits of the Egyptian upper-class: the money exchange
            on the stock market (<i>būrṣat miṣr</i>), health treatment in the
            baths of Ḥilwān (<i>al-ʿalīl</i>), the handling of the house
            employees and the matchmaker (<i>abū rīda l-barbarī
                wa-maʿshūqatuh kaʿb al-khayr</i>), the cousin-wedding of a girl who
            faithfully awaits the her beloved’s return while he is studying in England
                (<i>aṣ-ṣadāqa aʿnī zawāj as-sitt warda maʿ
                ibn ʿammiha</i>), the exaltation of everything French (<i>al-amīra
                l-iskandarānīya</i>) and the problems of polygamy
                (<i>aḍ-ḍarratayn</i>). </p>
        <p>The only play in Arabic, separately published during Sanua’s lifetime, <i>The Egyptian
                Molière</i>, must be considered the least typical example of his short experience as
            a playwright.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> The plot is presented as
            autobiographical and summarizes the problems Sanua encountered while managing his
            theater company.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> Unlike the rest of
            Sanua’s plays in Najm’s collection, his <i>Egyptian Molière</i> was composed in <i>zajal
            </i>(rhymed-prose). It was most probably rewritten before its publication. As a matter
            of fact, during the outline of <i>The Egyptian Molière</i>, the the actors are quoting
            dialogues from former plays which do not coincide with the corresponding texts of
            Muḥammad Yūsuf Najm’s publication.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>
        </p>
        <p>Sanua’s legacy of manuscripts contains two more unpublished theater-plays. One is a one
            act sketch in French, called <i>Bou la-la</i> and the other one is a full-length Arabic
            play the title of which was destroyed. Both of them will soon be publicly accessible for
            the first time on this website.</p>

            <a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Sanua himself clearly includes the one
            act sketches within the 32 plays. Chelley quotes an article by Jules Barbier in the
            journal <i>L’Ezbékié </i>where the latter praises Sanua for having held 160 performances
            in two seasons and having written 32 plays reaching from the farce in one act up to the
            drama in five acts. Chelley, J., “Le Molière Egyptien”, in <i>Abou Naddara</i>, nr. 6, 1
