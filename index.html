    <h3>Welcome to the Abou Naddara Collection website!</h3>
    <p>﻿This website offers the complete <a href="journals.html">newspapers</a> published by the
        Egyptian nationalist <a href="biography.html">James Sanua (يعقوب صنوع, 1839-1912)</a> from
        1878 to 1910. In addition, formerly unpublished manuscripts by the same author, articles
        from newspapers of the period about the journalist and his oeuvre, as well as the
        decorations he received are also available. Most of the material was directly scanned from
        the originals published at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, and therefore contains
        an ample variety of magnificent and colorful lithographs. </p>
    <p>It was financed by the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de">Cluster of
            Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context”</a> of Heidelberg University and
