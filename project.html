<p>Access to James Sanua's journal publications and his extensive oeuvre has hitherto been difficult. Threfore, the journalistic and artistic material of the Paris-exiled egyptian nationalist has hardly received the degree of scholarly attention it actually deserves. Nevertheless, during the research-work for her Ph.D. dissertation "The Construction of a National-Self through the Definition of its Enemy in James Sanua's Early Satirical Writings" Eliane Ursula Ettmueller was able to collect James Sanua's complete works and –even more importantly– the majority of the originals of his magazines. </p>
<p>Mrs Eva Milhaud kindly gave her the permission to have Sanua's legacy digitized and to make it available to interested readers and researchers all over the world. However, as the newspaper-series of the period from August 1878 to December 1884 and of the ones published between 1908 and 1910 were not among the originals, Prof. Dr. Nagwa Anous made it possible for her to have the reprints scanned which were published by Dar Sader in Beirut in 1974.</p>
<p>The project to produce a website of James Sanua's complete works derived from Project B1 "Gauging Cultural Asymmetries: Asian Satire and the Search for Identity in the Era of Colonialism and Imperialism" at the Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context" of Heidelberg University from which it received its major funding. It was realized in a collaborative endeavor with the Visual Resources Team of the Cluster's Heidelberg Research Architecture.</p>
<p>Responsible in the process of the elaboration were the following:
<ul><li>Prof. Dr. Hans Harder (Head of the Research Project B1)</li>
<li>Dr. Eliane Ursula Ettmueller (researcher, editor)</li>
<li>Matthias Arnold M.A. (technical consultant, conceptual design)</li>
<li>Johannes Alisch M.A. (assistant editor)</li>
<li>Nina Sassani (assistant editor)</li>
<li>Florian Kempf (assistant editor)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Eliane Ettmüller's Ph.D. thesis has been published as "The Construct of Egypt's National-Self in James Sanua's Early Satire & Caricature", Studien zum Modernen Orient 22, Klaus Schwarz Verlag 2012.
