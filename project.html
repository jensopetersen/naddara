    <h3>Project</h3>
    <p>﻿Access to James Sanua’s journal publications and his extensive oeuvre has hitherto been difficult.
        This is the reason why publications by the Paris-exiled Egyptian nationalist have hardly 
        received the degree of scholarly attention they actually deserve. Yet, during the 
        research-work for her Ph.D. dissertation “The Construction of a National-Self through the Definition 
        of its Enemy in James Sanua’s Early Satirical Writings” Eliane Ursula Ettmueller was able to collect 
        James Sanua’s complete works and –even more importantly– the majority of the originals of his magazines </p>
    <p>Mrs Eva Milhaud kindly gave her permission to have Sanua’s legacy digitized and to make it 
        available to interested readers and researchers all over the world. However, as the newspaper-series 
        of the period from August 1878 to December 1884 and of the ones published between 1908 and 1910 were 
        not among the originals, Prof. Dr. Nagua Ibrāhīm ʿAnūs made it possible for her to have 
        the reprints scanned which were published by Dar Sader in Beirut in 1974.</p>
    <p>The project to produce a website of James Sanua’s complete works derived from <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/b-public-spheres/b1.html">Project B1 “Gauging 
        Cultural Asymmetries: Asian Satire and the Search for Identity in the Era of Colonialism and 
        Imperialism”</a> at the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de">Cluster of Excellence</a> “Asia and Europe in a Global Context” of Heidelberg University 
        from which it received its major funding. It was realized in a collaborative endeavor with the Visual 
        Resources Team of the Cluster’s <a href="http://hra.uni-hd.de">Heidelberg Research Architecture</a>.</p>
    <p>Responsible in the process of the elaboration were the following:</p>
