        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Yaʿqūb Ṣannuʿ يعقوب صنوع (James Sanua by his own French transliteration) was born in
            Cairo, in April 1839,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="Footnote 1">[1]</a> as the son of an
            Egyptian Jew with Spanish Sephardic roots. First, he studied the books of the three
            monotheistic religions and, at the same time, Hebrew, Arabic, English and Italian, under
            the supervision of his father Rafāʾīl. Impressed by the precocity of the young talent,
            Aḥmad Yakan Bāsha<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="Footnote 2">[2]</a>, his father's
            employer, granted him a scholarship, which made it possible for the thirteen year old
            James to complete his studies in Italy. He arrived in Livorno in 1853, where he
            acquainted himself with Italian drama and the ideas of Mazzini's Young Italy movement. </p>
        <p>In 1855 Sanua returned to Egypt. After both, his father and his wealthy protector died he
            found himself financially on his own. He subsequently became a private teacher and
            worked his way through the rich Egyptian families until he attained a position at the
            Ecole Polytechnique (<i>al-Muhandiskhana</i>), where he taught from 1868 until
            1871.&#160; At the same time, he was employed as an examiner at the governmental
            schools.</p>
        <p>On 25<sup>th</sup> February 1868, he was initiated to the Egyptian Masonic Lodge <i>La
                Concordia</i>, where he ascended to the Degree of a Master on 24<sup>th</sup>
            December of the same year.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="Footnote 3">[3]</a> He was a
            very active Freemason throughout his entire life and is to be found in different other
            lodges such as the <i>Kawkab ash-Sharq, </i>which the famous Jamāl ad-Dīn
            al-Afghānī&#160; led in 1878.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="Footnote 4">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>In 1870, when Sanua was still busy teaching at the Ecole Polytechnique, he decided to
            found his own Arabic theatre. Sanua was inspired by the performance of an open-air
            café-concert of an Italian troupe during the summer of 1870; he then started to
            translate European plays into Arabic, before attempting to write his own. For his first
            play, Sanua casted some of his students from the <i>Ecole Polytechnique</i>. After his
            initial success, Sanua applied to the Khedive for a regular income for his troupe, like
            that usually paid to the European theatre companies. He was therefore invited by the
            Khedive to perform at his palace Qaṣr al-Nīl in just three months since the start of
            his theatrical activities. On this occasion, his troupe performed three of his comedies,
                <i>anīsa ālā mūd</i>
            <i>̣a </i>(The Fashionable Young Lady)<i>, ghandūr mis</i>
            <i>̣r</i> (The Egyptian Dandy) and <i>al-ḍurratān</i> (The two Co-Wives). Sanua
            reports that after the first two plays had finished, the Khedive was so delighted that
            he came up to him onto the stage and said: 'You are truly the founder of our national
            theatre, you are our Egyptian Molière.'<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="Footnote 5">[5]</a>
            Nevertheless, the third play's harsh criticism of polygamy created problems. After
            witnessing the struggles of the main character Aḥmad's two co-wives, the Khedive was
            furious and told Sanua that if he were not man enough to satisfy two wives, he should at
            least leave the ones who were able to do so alone. </p>
        <p>By the end of the year 1871, Sanua's theatre was shut down and he became more involved
            with Freemasonry. In 1873,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="Footnote 6">[6]</a> he
            established the Lodge of Progress (<i>Maḥfal at-Taqqadum</i>), which was mainly
            attended by students and officers, according to de Blaignières.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="Footnote 7">[7]</a> After its forced disappearance in 1875, Sanua
            established the Society of the Lovers of Knowledge (<i>Jamʿīyat al-muh</i>
            <i>̣ibbi l-ʿilm</i>) in which a lot of Azhar-shaykhs are said to have participated,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="Footnote 8">[8]</a> among them Jamāl ad-Dīn
                al-Afghānī.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="Footnote 9">[9]</a>
        </p>
        <p>The second one of his secret societies was forcedly closed too and in 1874, Sanua
            departed for a long travel through Europe. Back in Egypt, he tried to convince the
            Khedive Ismāʿīl about the necessity of liberal reforms. </p>
        <p>As the Khedive failed to listen to his demands, in 1877, Sanua founded a satiric
            newspaper in order to raise national and political consciousness among the Egyptian
            people. However, his first <i>Abū Naz</i>
            <i>̣z</i>
            <i>̣āra Zarqā</i> (The Man with the Blue Glasses) lasted only two months before being
            forbidden. On the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 1878, after two failed attacks against his
            life, Sanua was finally forced to leave his beloved homeland and to go into exile.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="Footnote 10">[10]</a> Nevertheless, in less than eight
            weeks after his departure from Egypt, Sanua was ready to continue publishing his
            newspaper, even in a slightly changed format, with a caricature on the cover-page. </p>
        <p>In Paris Sanua held lectures in different literary circles and actively participated in
            Masonic lodges. He claims to have been in touch not only with the most outstanding
            exiled Egyptians in Paris but also with the most important French politicians up to the
            rank of the President. In public he usually performed as the “over-orientalized”
            character, Shaykh Abou Naddara, who displayed his <i>galabiyya</i>, turban and his
            multiple decorations. Sanua most obviously fought for a free Egypt - free from the local
            tyrants and the British occupation. At the same time, he kept loyal to the Sultan as the
            representative of the Islamic Umma (community of the faithful) throughout his life. Most
            importantly, the Egyptian exiled nationalist constantly tried to mediate between “the
            East” and “the West” and always displayed a special sympathy for Islam.</p>
        <p>As far as family is concerned, in 1884, Sanua married a French Jewish lady, Zélie
            Blumenthal with whom he had two children, Hilmi and Louli (1886-1967)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="Footnote 11">[11]</a>. After a long active life as an editor of his
            diverse magazines, James Sanua retired in 1910, only two years before his death.</p>
