        <h3>Introduction: Journals</h3>
        <p>Sanua published the first issue of his <i>Abou Naddara</i> series in Cairo, on March 25,
            1878, <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&#160; under the title
            <i>Abū Naẓẓāra Zarqāʾ</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The two months
            of its publishing were also the last ones during which Sanua was able to work
            as a satirical journalist in his home country. The major part of
            Sanua’s publications were therefore issued in Paris during the thirty-two years of his active life
            as a writer.</p>
        <p>Sanua produced twelve visually experimental newspaper-series in the period between 1878
            and 1885. Starting from 1885, the structure, name and layout of the <i>Abou Naddara</i>
            series became more stable. There are different reasons for shifts in titles and layouts
            during the initial seven years. </p>
        <p>Firstly, Sanua himself had to become acquainted with the new techniques of lithography
            which he was able to explore in the Parisian printing shops. In the first newspaper
            produced in exile, which Sanua presented as a personal travelogue –<i>Riḥlat Abī
                Naẓẓāra Zarqā min Miṣr al-Qāhira ilā Bārīs al-Fakhira</i>-, he therefore
            introduced simple caricatures and drawings. These illustrations became more
            sophisticated in the second newspaper-series of the year 1879 called <i>Abū Naẓẓāra
                Zarqā</i>. Sanua, most probably starting from that moment, hired a professional
            drawing artist. </p>
        <p>The Egyptian journalist in exile also experimented in style and literary genres before
            his articles were shaped more and more according to the standards of&#160; the French
            satirical press of the same period. At the same time as his caricatures became more
            elaborate, Sanua started to introduce descriptive French translations to the texts
            linked to the drawings. Already the collected thirty numbers of his travelogue were
            provided with an epilogue which included a list of the illustrations, each with a short explanation in French. However, apart from these short elucidating translations of the
            drawings, Sanua’s journals became plainly bilingual at the same time as the title
                <i>Abou Naddara</i> and the layout were settled in 1885. One great exception to this
            are the two issues of <i>The Egyptian Patriot</i> –written in English- which Sanua
            designed in 1883 in order to make the British occupiers become aware of the danger
            emanating from the Egyptian intellectuals’ opposition to their politics.</p>
        <p>The second reason why Sanua did not stick to the layout and title of his journals right
            from the beginning is that he had to circumvent the khedivial press censorship which,
            especially in the year 1880, under Riyāḍ’s Prime Ministry, made it extremely difficult
            for him to have the magazines smuggled into the country. At the same time, Sanua
            recorded that his readers faced severe punishment whenever they were caught with his
            subversive, satirical writings. Therefore <i>Abū Naẓẓāra</i> (the man with the
            glasses) on 4<sup>th</sup> June 1880 suddenly appeared as <i>Abū Ṣuffāra</i> (the
            flute-player) and afterwards, only five weeks later, turned into <i>Abū Zammāra</i>
            (the clarinet-player). By the end of the same year Sanua self-ironically recognized his
            talent as a transforming-artist and newly introduced his alter-ego character –who
            usually provided the name for his magazines- as a charmer (<i>al-Ḥāwī</i>). After
            this phase of extreme changeability, in April 1881, <i>Abou Naddara</i> was given its
            French name which –apart from minor variations- was kept by until 1910.</p>
        <p>Starting from 1885, Sanua usually published a collected volume by the end of each year
            and added two additional covers, one in French and one in Arabic. The biggest of these
            kinds of collections is the one which unites the newspapers published from 1901 until
            1906. </p>
        <p>In 1888, Sanua started an additional monthly journal with the name <i>at-Tawwaddud</i>,
            translated into French with <i>Sympathisons</i> (let’s corroborate),<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> which was clearly intended to make people in Egypt
            gain more insight into European politics. Already during the foundational year, the cover displayed a short
            summary of the Arabic content in French which became more extensive over time.
            Unfortunately, the originals of the four collected volumes of <i>L’Attawadod</i>
            published between 1894 and 1897 vanished. No reprints were made of these journals and
            the only way to access the texts are by consulting the microfilms in the Bibliothèque
            Nationale de France. This is the reason why they cannot be found on this website. </p>
        <p>Another newspaper was established by Sanua in 1899. It was published bilingually (Arabic
            and French) right from the beginning and included into the yearly collected volumes next
            to <i>L’Attawadod</i> and <i>Abou Naddara</i>. Its title was <i>L’Almonsef
                (L’Equitable)</i> and its proclaimed aim was to judge the enemies and the friends of
            the Eastern people righteously.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> As much
            as the texts and drawings of <i>L’Attawadod</i>, the content of this new journal was not
            meant to be satirical.</p>
        <p>Sanua started one last, entirely French magazine called <i>L’Univers Musulman</i> in
            1907. This journal was printed on pink pages and photographs were added to the drawn
            lithographs. The opening poem solemnly proclaims the goal of the publication in a
            prayer-like format.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> The journal aimed
            to explain Islamic culture to its French readership in order to make them lose their
            fear and prejudice towards this religion. Christians and Muslims were encouraged to
            collaborate in an understanding, peaceful and constructive way.</p>

            <a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The date printed on the first
            cover-page of Sanua’s <i>abū naẓẓāra zarqā</i> is: 21 / 3 / 1295. Blanchard Jerrold
            suggests 1<sup>st</sup> April 1878 as the day when Sanua’s first newspaper was launched.
            Jacob Landau and Irene Gendzier indicate 21<sup>st</sup> March 1877 as its date of
            issue. They wrongly copied it from dī Ṭarrāzī who takes up that date and enlists
                <i>abū naẓẓāra zarqā</i> as the sixth newspaper published in Cairo. (After
                <i>al-waqāʾiʿ al-miṣrīya</i> (3rd of December 1828), <i>wādī an-nīl</i>
